Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hugh, an undergraduate student studying Information Technology with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence. This GitHub Pages site is where I showcase my projects, code, and learnings. I hope you find something useful or interesting here.

## About Me

I'm passionate about technology and how it can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. My current focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy exploring new algorithms, building models, and understanding the real-world use cases.

When I'm not coding or studying, I love to read about the latest trends in tech, fly drones, and tinker with new software tools.

## Projects

### Social Sentiment Analysis App

- **Description:** The goal of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that can accurately gauge public sentiment by analyzing large volumes of social media data. This tool will be particularly useful for understanding public opinion on various subjects, ranging from brand perception to reactions to current events.
-  **Technologies Used:** Python, Google Colab, Microsoft Copilot
-  **Code:** [VibeCheck](https://github.com/hughsio/VibeCheck)

### Domain Inquiry Toolkit

   - **Description:** This is a Python script I've been tinkering with that delves into the world of domain registrations. I've crafted it to help curious minds like you and me uncover the age of domains and peek into their registration details.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Copilot
   - **Code:** [Whois Lookup Calculator](https://github.com/hughsio/whois-lookup-calculator)
